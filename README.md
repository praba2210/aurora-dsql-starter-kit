## Overview

Amazon Aurora DSQL is a serverless, distributed SQL database optimized for transactional workloads. This starter kit provides comprehensive documentation and resources to help you get started with Aurora DSQL.

## 📚 Documentation

This repository contains documentation built with [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) and the Material theme, following AWS documentation best practices.

## 🚀 What is Aurora DSQL?

Amazon Aurora DSQL is a serverless, distributed SQL database that provides:

- **Serverless Architecture** - No infrastructure to manage
- **Distributed Design** - Built for high availability and scalability
- **PostgreSQL Compatibility** - Use familiar PostgreSQL tools and syntax
- **Multi-Region Support** - Deploy across multiple AWS regions
- **ACID Compliance** - Full transactional consistency

## 📖 Getting Started

Check out the [Getting Started Guide](docs/guides/getting-started/quickstart.md) to:

1. Create your first Aurora DSQL cluster
2. Connect to your cluster
3. Run your first queries
4. Set up multi-region clusters

## AI Rules

This repository also contains AI rules that can help create a more seamless agentic developing experience with DSQL. The recommended paths are to either use the Kiro Power or the Claude Skill, thought the 
[dsql-skill](/ai-rules/skills/dsql-skill/) can also be repurposed for other coding assistants. 

### Kiro Power

To setup the Kiro power:
1. Install directly from the [Kiro Powers Registry](https://kiro.dev/launch/powers/aurora-dsql/)
2. Once redirected to the Power in the IDE either:
   1. Select the **`Try Power`** button. Suggested for people who want:
      - The AI to guide MCP server setup
      - An interactive onboarding experience with DSQL to create a new cluster
   2. Open a new Kiro chat and ask anything related to DSQL 
      - **Optionally update the MCP Config:** Add your existing cluster details and test the MCP server connection
        so the MCP server can be used out of the box with the power. 
      - The Kiro agent automatically activates the power when prompted

### Claude Skill

The recommended setup is outlined in [skill_setup.md](/ai-rules/skills/skill_setup.md). This method uses a sparse
clone of the skill folder alone symlinked into the desired `.claude/skills/` folder which also means the latest
changes can be consistently pulled in to update the skill.
